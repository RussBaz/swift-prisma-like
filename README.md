# Swift-Prisma-Like (SPL)

Only PostgreSQL and SQLite support is planned for now.

The concept behind this project is to be able to generate a strongly typed database access client in Swift from a schema file that matches the `Prisma` schema files as much as practically possible.

Please note that the specifications for the `Prisma` schema are not up-to-date, and referring to the source all the time is not a feasible long-term solution. Therefore, some liberties in interpreting the schema are permitted.
